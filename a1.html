      <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!</p>
      <p>Here are sources I used: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKekzzj5844">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKekzzj5844</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1FVSpkw6q4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1FVSpkw6q4</a> </p>
      <p> Schematic </p>
      <img src="IMG_0296.jpg" width="500" height="500"/>
      <p> Resistor Calulcation: Voltage power = 5V and Voltage drop for Red, Yellow, and Green LED's = 1.8V and Current = 20mA<br>
      V = 5-1.8 = 3.2V <br>
      Ohm's Law: V = I x R <br>
      3.2 = 0.02 x R <br>
      R = 160 Ohms <br>
      Therefore, I used 220 Ohms for the resistors. <br>

      <p> Code Snippet </p>
      <p> // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board <br>
        void setup() { <br>
          // Initialize the digital pins as an output <br>
          pinMode(12, OUTPUT); <br>
          pinMode(13, OUTPUT);<br>
          pinMode(11, OUTPUT); <br>
        }<br>
        
        // the loop function runs over and over again forever <br>
        void loop() { <br>
          // Turn the red LED on by making the voltage level high <br>
          digitalWrite(13, HIGH); <br>
          // Wait for a second <br>
          delay(1000); <br>                      
          // Turn the same LED off by making the voltage level low <br>
          digitalWrite(13, LOW); <br>
          // Wait for a second <br>
          delay(1000); <br>      
          // Turn the green LED on by making the voltage level high <br>
          digitalWrite(12, HIGH); <br>
          // Wait for a second <br>
          delay(1000); <br>
          // Turn the same LED off by making the voltage level low <br>                 
          digitalWrite(12, LOW); <br>
          delay(1000); <br>
          // Turn the yellow LED on by making the voltage level high <br>
          digitalWrite(11, HIGH); <br>
          // Wait for a second <br>
          delay(1000); <br>
          // Turn the same LED off by making the voltage level low <br>
          digitalWrite(11, LOW); <br>
          // Wait for a second <br>
          delay(1000); <br>
        } <br> </p>

      <p> Questions and Answers</p>
      <p> Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</p>

      <p> How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</p>
      There could be about 20 LEDs we could blink independently with the Arduino and the current it would draw would be around 20mA each.
      <p> How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking? <br>
        Around 3 milliseconds.
